-- THeorems

[Theorem A]
Doens't quite work; cards are quite a hodge-podge, don't provide a good "deck theme"
Rather than symmetric community piles , you buy from your own "meta-deck", which is dependent
on the character.

Combat is combat. Need more attack cards, and reaction cards.
Dagger Thrust (1 action, 2 Damage)
Hammer Smash (3 Damage)
Feinted Slash (1 card, 1 action, 1 damage)
Dodge (Avoid attack card that deals damage)
Riposte (Avoid attack card that deals damage, Deal back X damage in hand and redraw cards)
Counter (Avoid attack, Deal back the damage dealt)
Defensive Ward (Avoid attack, 2 card)

Victoy Points kind of works, but ... what if they become Damage and are used by Attack cards?
This plays a similar role (might fill up your hand and reduces flexibility) but with an eye
towards victory.
Mighty Slash (2 cards, X damage) -- where X is the total of Damage cards in hand.
Critical Strike (X damage) -- where X is the multiplier of all Damage cards in hand (whoa!)

What if we want multi-characters?
1) Multi deck, multi-hand, multi-turn.  Complex.
2) Multi deck, multi-hand (or single hand but only special cards can be shared), action per character in a single turn.

[Theorem B]
With non-symmetric deck we lose deck matching!
Kind of.  It is limited... you don't share community deck, therefore can't 'starve' out a card, and also you don't know the opponent deck off hand (its now different than yours) so it's harder to know what the other player is doing and plan for it.

------------------

Card props: 
- Exp Cost (how much exp it costs to acquire the card)
- Name & Desc
- Card Type (Action, Reaction, Attack?)
- Traits (X Actions, X Exp, X Buy, X Card Pickup)
- Use constraints (in combat, in travel, diplomacy, during camp, ... )

To replace multiplayers, we roughly replace players with a game world with appropriate isomorphisms.

To replace deck matching / dynamic play, the world changes.

To replace the unpredictable time limit, the changing world determines the game-over case.

To recreate kingdom card sinks, the world state may act as a drain for particular cards (eg. if training can be acquired in teh city, overrun cities may deplete these availabilities)

Spy used to peer into the enemy hand; analagous to peering into hidden game world state.

Attack and defense are roughly analagous to gaining advantage on the world state and resisting penalties the world inflicts upon you, respectively.
